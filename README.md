Bouncing Balls is a visually enhanced, interactive browser game built entirely using HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks). The player controls a bucket at the bottom of the screen and must catch bouncing balls to score points. Missing a ball costs a life — lose all 3 lives, and it’s game over!

This version of the game focuses on modern design, smooth animations, and responsive controls, making it both fun and visually polished.
